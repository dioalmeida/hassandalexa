Following this tutorial:

    https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa.smart_home

We can build a simple that can communicate sensor data with Alexa, thus, we  are able to query Alexa for information and also receive real-time notifications anywhere anytime.

We've included some configurations files, that will get you started or at least give some kind of basic knowledge for you to get started.
Along with the config files we include some blueprints and automations as examples to what you can do.

This project was made with Aqara sensors so we include a config file for Zigbee2MQTT as well.
